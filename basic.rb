# Hello, welcome to Ruby! This is a comment that can't see by the compiler.
# There are four basic data types in Ruby, and they are:

intro_string = "This is a string!"
this_is_an_integer = 51     # whole number
this_is_a_float = 125.12    # decimal
this_is_a_bool = false

# When you want to call a variable, you just use type the name of the variable, like:

intro_string
this_is_an_integer
this_is_a_float
this_is_a_bool

# Now, to run a program in Ruby, you need to type `ruby [name_of_file].rb` in the terminal 
# in the folder where the file lives. For example, to run this file, you would type: `ruby basic.rb`

# Try to run it now.

# If you run the file, you will notice that nothing appears in the terminal. Why is that?
# To see any code in the terminal, you have to use 'puts' in front of the variable(s) you want to see.

# Delete the '=begin' and run the program again.
